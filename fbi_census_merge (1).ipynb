    "> We can see that while Illinois may be on the lower end for 2014, being around the 100000 range for permits issued every month in 2014, Kentucky is much higher. Kentucky is consistently almost double Illinois with around 250000 per month. The scatterplot shows us that North Carolina spiked in March of 2013 with greater than 500000 permits issued in a single month. I was curious about why there was such a random spike in North Carolina in March of 2013 and was able to find a news article from the Channel 5 Wral News (Raleigh, North Carolina). \n",
    ">\n",
    "> The news article, written in December of 2012, was talking about the Newton, Connecticut shooting and how people wanted to arm themselves more. The article went on to talk about gun laws on the federal, state, and local level and how they would be affected by the upcoming 2013 fire arm bill. Another article from the same news station talks about the sweeping 2013 gun bill in North Carolina. This was not The Assault Weapons Bill of 2013 that congress introduced to put a federal ban on automatic assautl weapons. The state law expanded on people being able to bring concealed carry guns into bars and as well as removing information about those who hold a conceal carry permit from public view. It would also roll back restrictions on sheriffs and how many handgun permits they are allowed to sign off on. The bill also strenghtened penalties for those who violate gun laws and would require that mental illness be included in the background checks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One could only reasonably assume that after a horrific tragedy like the Newton, Connecticut massacre that people would want to buy more guns to protect themselves. It could also be reasonably assumed that if a new gun law was being proposed in 2013 at the state and federal level, people were afraid that new gun restrictions might go into place and they were trying to get their hands on a firearm beforehand.\n",

Where it gets really interesting is when we look at Kentucky, the population in 2016 was 4,436,974 while the amount of gun permits obtained was 10,713,721. There were more than double the amout of gun permits issued in the 5 years from 2011-2015 than there were people in the state of Kentucky.

These results are also federal, it does not account for state level background checks and if they are neccesary or not in that particular state.

    "\n",
    "> After the Sandy Hook Massacre and the Assault Weapons ban bill of 2013 that was introduced for federal gun regulation, people were afraid. They were afraid that their automatic assault weapons would be taken away. The bill was shot down in April of 2013 so it never came to fruition but that didn't mean that people weren't still weary of the government interfeering with the second amendment. One can only assume that's why there was a massive spike in gun permits being issued in 2014 and the trend is only going upward with more being issued every year.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Trying to understand the gun permits being issued in correlation to census data is difficult. There are so many unknown variables. We could try to speculate that less educated and more impoverished states like Kentucky have more gun permits issued but I don't feel confident in saying that and I don't have the evidence to support it. Only 6% of Kentucky goes without health insurance and their gun permits issued are over double the population of the state while in North Carolina, 12% are in poverty and 18.94% of the population were issed gun permits. <b>Correlation does NOT imply causation!</b>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The data sets were not very detailed in what they were supplying. The census data especially- data being all over the place, dates being in the same columns with facts, wrong data types everywhere, undescriptive fact column, random FIPS codes at the bottom of the dataframe. The gun data wasn't so hard to work with as it was not detailed enough. It doesn't take into consideration that some states have different laws that allow for people to buy guns without a gun permit. Outliers like Puerto Rico, Marianna Islands, etc. that shouldn't have been included (even though they are US territory). There were many unknowns."
